I'm Nutelyn, who lurk in the dark just because she can't deal with light, \
who likes a night stroll and explore the darkest of the darkest, \
hold your grand expectation, thus great things takes time, \
i'm Nutelyn she who looks and do nothing but locking herself \
in a small prison called room \
this is my word of pain, this is me, i'm nutelyn the harbinger of the N.E.E.T
